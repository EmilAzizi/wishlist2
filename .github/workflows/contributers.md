For contributers.

Welcome to our opensource wishlist project, in this file, we will go through the necesary rules and regulations you need to uphold, before you start contributing to our project.

- Adding new code.
Adding new code should be done, in its own branch, and merged after getting it reviewed by a MEA member, and then later accepted or declined depending
on if your code will have any issues sorround existing code.

- Deleting code.
Deleting existing code, should only be done by MEA members, unless it's code that you have been programming yourself. The code structure is quite sensitive,
and unless you dont have a clear overview of the base code, deleting can cause harm, aswell as an unfunctional project.

- Updating/changing code.
We are always looking for more ways to improve our code, in which case, create a new branch from the branch you wish code to be updated, and change
the code you see a problem with, after that create a pull request and the MEA members will evaluate, and accept or decline.

- Commit messages
Commit messages should be short, but precise, give an overview of the changes/additions/deletions that you have commited.

- Consistency
Consistency is key in our project, naming variables and functions should be done with a red line in mind. F.eks

all your vabriables should start with a lowercase letter, if the name contains multiple words, the letter should then be uppercase like: thisIsMyFirstVariable.

No names should start with a number, or a prebuild programming function like: 1DoNotNameLikeThis, publicDoNotNameLikeThis.
